    <h1>The Journey of Jay and Julia </h1>
    <p> Once upon a time, a Texan boy and a French girl traveled to the not-so-great state of Missouri to pursue their long-time dreams of becoming journalists.
      Jay was a willing photojournalism student, while Julia was forced out of her chosen major by school bureaucracy.
      As fate would have it, this mess of prerequsites would set up their meeting in Picture Story and Photographic Essay, the capstone course for
      photojournalism students and one of Julia's first introductions to photojournalism. This would lead them on a whirlwind courtship filled with angst, Wendy's and late-night movies.

      <p>However, fate came calling all too quickly, and Julia had to return to France just two months into the young couple's relationship.
      Jay and Julia tried to stay in touch, but the pressures of the last semester of school and a long-distance relationship proved to be too
       much after a while. For seven weeks, they didn't speak.
<br><br>

      Back in Columbia, Jay couldn't sleep. He tossed and turned, unable to stop his mind from racing. He needed to get his thoughts out.
      He grabbed a pen and paper and wrote as fast as he could. What started as a rant turned into a letter of all the ways he thought about her
      and an admission of his love. This letter sat in his room for weeks. "Should I send it? Does she even want to hear from me?"
      <br> <br>

      One trip to the post office and three agonizing weeks later, Jay's phone vibrates.

      <br><br>

      It's her.

    <br><br>
    In the blink of an eye, Jay graduates with a bachelor's of journalism and heads to Houston to look for a job. Anxiously, but eagerly,
    he makes plans to go to Paris. It's been six months since they last saw each other. Will they still get along? Will it be the same as it
    was before she left? It's awkward at the airport, but they love each other more than ever.

      </p>

    <p>Another six months pass, and now Jay is waiting at the airport for Julia. Reunited at last- and this time for the long term.
      She's got a year-long contract in the States, and now they can fulfill their IKEA dreams in an apartment of their own. Things are good
      now, and only the future lies ahead of them.
